        <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F and line a 9x9 baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Combine butter and semisweet chocolate chips in a large, microwave-safe bowl.</li>
            <li>Microwave for 30 seconds.  Stir well, microwave for another 15 seconds and then stir well again.  Repeat for 15 seconds until chocolate and butter are completely melted and well-combined.</li>
            <li>Add cocoa powder and stir well.</li>
            <li>Add sugars and stir until completely combined.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, one at a time.  After each addition, stir well, and then stir another 30 seconds (the better you stir your batter, the cracklier your brownie tops will be).</li>
            <li>Stir in vanilla extract and salt.</li>
            <li>Add flour, stir until completely combined.  You cannot overmix this batter, make sure it is mixed very well.</li>
            <li>stir in chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Spread into prepared 9x9 pan.</li>
            <li>Remove from refrigerator and bake on 350F (177C) for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out slightly fudgy, but not wet with batter.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool before cutting and serving.</li>
        </ol>
